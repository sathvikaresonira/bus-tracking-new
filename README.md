## Implementation Details

### Parent Notification App Features

#### 1. Dashboard/Home Screen
- **Current Status**: Implemented a `StatusCard` with distinct visual states (At Home, On Bus, At School) using rich gradients and shadows (e.g., "Safe at home" in emerald green).
- **Live Map View**: Added a "Live Map Preview" card on the dashboard showing a visual representation of the bus route, complete with pulsing "Live" indicators and a "View Full Map" action.
- **Next Expected Event**: The `ETACard` features a countdown timer (e.g., "Bus Arriving in 8 min") with a dynamic progress bar and animated background.

#### 2. Notification History
- **Timeline**: The `Notifications` page displays a clean timeline of boarding/alighting events.
- **Iconography**: Distinct icons and color schemes for "To School" (Sky Blue + Bus/School icons) and "Return Home" (Violet + Bus/Home icons).
- **GPS Details**: Events show precise timestamps and GPS coordinates as requested.

#### 3. Visual Style
- **Theme**: Adhered to the "Safe & Trustworthy" palette using soft blues (`sky-500`), reassuring greens (`emerald-500`), and school-bus yellows (`amber-400`).
- **Aesthetics**: Utilized modern glassmorphism effects (blurs), smooth gradients, and micro-animations (pulsing dots, fade-ins) to ensure a premium feel.

#### 4. Critical States
- **Alerts**: Implemented an content-aware `AlertBanner` that pulses red/amber for critical incidents (delays, accidents) to immediately grab attention.

#### 5. Navigation Structure
- **Home**: Dashboard with status and live preview.
- **Track**: Full-screen live tracking.
- **Alerts**: History of all notifications.
- **Profile**: Student details and RFID status.
