# Codebase Overview: Bus Management System (BMS)

This document serves as the primary context for the coding assistant. It outlines the structure, technology stack, and architectural decisions of the project.

## 1. Project Overview
The **Bus Management System (BMS)** is a comprehensive solution for managing school/organization bus fleets. It serves three primary user roles:
- **Admin**: Fleet management, student tracking, route optimization, attendance monitoring, and system settings.
- **Parent**: Live bus tracking, student notifications, profile management, and contacting support.
- **Driver**: Route navigation, shift management, and receiving alerts.

---

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **State Management**: React Context API (`DataContext`) and [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (React Query).
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS).
- **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Maps**: [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) with [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- **Simulation**: Integrated bus movement and status simulation in `DataContext`.

## 4. Routing & User Roles
The application uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
- **Root (`/`)**: Login Selection.
- **Login (`/login/:role`)**: Dynamic login for Admin, Driver, or Parent.
- **Admin Section (`/admin`)**:
  - `/admin/dashboard`: Overview of stats and active fleet.
  - `/admin/tracking`: Live map with all active buses.
  - `/admin/students`: Student CRUD and RFID management.
  - `/admin/buses`: Bus and Driver management.
  - `/admin/attendance`: Scan logs and attendance reporting.
  - `/admin/alerts`: System-wide alerts and notifications.
- **Parent Section (`/parent`)**:
  - `/parent/home`: Overview of child's bus status.
  - `/parent/track`: Detailed live tracking for the assigned bus.
  - `/parent/notifications`: Personal alerts (boarding, drop-off).
  - `/parent/profile`: Personal and child details management.
- **Driver Section (`/driver`)**:
  - `/driver/dashboard`: Daily shift summary.
  - `/driver/route`: Interactive route map and stop list.
  - `/driver/notifications`: Job assignments and emergency alerts.

## 5. Data Architecture
### `DataContext.tsx`
The backbone of the application's state. It manages:
- **Entities**: Students, Buses, Routes, Alerts, Drivers.
- **Persistence**: Synchronizes state with `localStorage` for offline-like behavior.
- **Simulation**: A `useEffect` interval simulates bus movement, speed changes, and status updates every 3 seconds.
- **CRUD Operations**: Centralized functions for updating any entity.

### `Map.tsx`
The primary visualization tool.
- Supports markers for buses (with rotation based on heading).
- Renders route polylines and stop markers.
- Features "Lock to Bus" (auto-centering) and full-screen modes.
- Integrated with `DataContext` to reflect real-time simulated movements.

---

## 6. Key Implementation Details
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first layouts for Parents and Drivers; Desktop-optimized for Admins.
- **Animations**: Using Framer Motion (implicitly in some components) or CSS transitions for smooth UI updates.
- **Theming**: Tailwind-based theme with custom palettes (likely defined in `tailwind.config.ts`).
- **Error Handling**: `ErrorBoundary` component wraps the routes to catch and display UI failures.
